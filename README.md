# ChatMate

A full stack social media application built step-by-step as a learning project for mastering frontend, backend, databases, and deployment.

The project starts with static UI and gradually evolves into a real-world full-stack app with authentication, posts, comments, likes, follows, notifications, and real-time chat.

# About

This project is designed as a learning roadmap for Full Stack Web Development.
It simulates a social media platform (like Twitter/Facebook-lite) and covers every layer of the stack:

- Frontend → HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend → Node.js, Express
- Database → MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Deployment → GitHub Pages, Netlify, Render, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas

The goal is to gain practical, end-to-end experience by building a feature-rich app incrementally.

# Tech Stack
Frontend

- HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS (Phase-1 basics)
- React.js with React Router, Context API/Redux (Phase-2+)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Axios / Fetch API for backend communication

Backend

- Node.js + Express.js
- JWT Authentication + bcrypt for security
- Multer / Cloudinary for image uploads

Database

- MongoDB + Mongoose ODM (primary choice)
- Optionally: PostgreSQL with Sequelize/Prisma ORM

Real-time

- Socket.io for chat and notifications

DevOps / Deployment

- Git + GitHub for version control
- Netlify / Vercel → Frontend hosting
- Render / Railway / Heroku → Backend hosting
- MongoDB Atlas / ElephantSQL → Cloud database
- GitHub Actions → CI/CD (tests + linting)
