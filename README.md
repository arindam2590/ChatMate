A full stack social media application built step-by-step as a learning project for mastering frontend, backend, databases, and deployment.

The project starts with static UI and gradually evolves into a real-world full-stack app with authentication, posts, comments, likes, follows, notifications, and real-time chat.

# About

This project is designed as a learning roadmap for Full Stack Web Development.
It simulates a social media platform (like Twitter/Facebook-lite) and covers every layer of the stack:

- Frontend → HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- Backend → Node.js, Express
- Database → MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Deployment → GitHub Pages, Netlify, Render, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas

The goal is to gain practical, end-to-end experience by building a feature-rich app incrementally.
