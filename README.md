# ChatMate

A full stack social media application built step-by-step as a learning project for mastering frontend, backend, databases, and deployment.

The project starts with static UI and gradually evolves into a real-world full-stack app with authentication, posts, comments, likes, follows, notifications, and real-time chat.
